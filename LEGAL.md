# LEGAL.md â€” Independence & Pre-existing Idea Statement

## 1. Project Origin & Chronology

- **20 May 2025:** Idea first recorded (reference to Kiss My Apps & market speedup frameworks, see [ChatGPT discussion](https://chatgpt.com/c/682ce91c-8b7c-8003-a7b4-f1d8865829f0)).
- **Following days:** Studied [ApparenceKit](https://apparencekit.dev), Mason, modular CLI design in open source.
- **First day at Ciklum:** Shared ApparenceKit as an open-source reference in the team chat, without any hidden agenda or intention to appropriate company/client ideas.
- **June 2025:** Final architecture/feature set formed, coding started (see first commit).
- **All work** performed outside work hours, on personal hardware, no company IP, no use of TZ, client code, or confidential docs.

## 2. Project Independence

- This project was created and developed without using any proprietary, confidential, or internal information, know-how, code, or technical specifications from any employer, including but not limited to Ciklum or its clients.
- All architecture, code, and docs are the result of my own research, public knowledge, and best practices.

## 3. Similarities & Open Source Notice

- Any architectural similarity with commercial frameworks is due to the nature of public libraries, market standards, and best practices in the Flutter community.
- No code, docs, or concepts from Ciklum or any client were used.
