/// The [DslGenerator] is responsible for invoking all registered [DslAwareCodeGenerator]
/// implementations with a unified [DslContext].
///
/// ### Architectural rationale:
/// Instead of relying on type checks like `if (generator is DiDslGenerator)`
/// and branching per-DSL, this class delegates responsibility to each module-specific
/// DSL generator by passing a shared context object.
///
/// This respects the Open/Closed Principle:
/// - New DSL types can be supported by creating new `DslAwareCodeGenerator` implementations.
/// - The [DslGenerator] class itself remains unchanged in its logic, only the context may evolve.
///
/// ### About [DslContext]:
/// [DslContext] acts as a container for all DSL-relevant data (e.g., DI dependencies, route definitions),
/// which are aggregated here. When a new DSL type is introduced, this is the only place
/// that needs minor adjustmentâ€”to enrich the context with the corresponding data.
///
/// While this may formally seem like a deviation from OCP, it's a deliberate trade-off
/// to avoid over-architecting via excessive abstractions (e.g., collectors, resolvers, or reflection),
/// which would reduce readability and traceability.
///
/// ### Summary:
/// This class balances architectural cleanliness and simplicity:
/// - No knowledge of individual DSL types
/// - Single-pass orchestration
/// - Localized and predictable evolution
///
/// This design is intentional, and avoids abstraction for its own sake.
